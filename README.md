# Letter Maze

## What's Letter Maze

Letter Maze is a clone of *Letras*, a game of *Clarin*, a newspaper from Argentina.
It's a puzzle of letters in which the player has to find a set of words.
Every letter in a word has to be adjacent to the next. Letters in diagonal can't be connected.

I loved to play that game but now it's behind a paywall. So I decided to write a clone.
